# The Git Story

Once upon a time, there were four friends who all decided to 
develop a platformer game called 'super smash profs'. They started by making a repository on the HdM gitlab and reading into the Libgdx engine docs.
At first, they were shocked by the complexity of libGDX and the huge amount of possibilities the libary had to offer.
They eventually figured it out and made the best game theyÂ´ve ever played.

The result was so good that even their fellow stundents wanted to try it and they couln't stop playing.

It was such a huge success that they started adding themselves and their Professors to the game as playable characters.
This came with the challenge that they needed to design the pixel style characters and think out animations for a smoother gaming experience.
Every character was handmade and has a jump animation, one for attacking and one for running.

To maintain the special vibe of playing with the actual "identity" of the game character, the special abilities of every character were adapted to the real personalities of the people being represented by the ingame characters.

As everyone knows, the gaming community is divided into two parties: The keyboard gamers and the controller fans. 
SuperSmashProfs was thought out as a multiplayer game from the early beginning, so it was obvious that everyone, regardless of his favourite HID, should enjoy playing it. 
Because of that the dev team implemented the option to choose between the two input methods: Keyboard and controller.
